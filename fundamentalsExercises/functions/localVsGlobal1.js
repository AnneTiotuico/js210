What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run the code

var myVar = 'This is global';

function someFunction() {
  var myVar = 'This is local';
}

someFunction();
console.log(myVar);

/*
This will log 'This is global' because the myVar variable is in the global scope,
therefore it is accessible on line 13. It isn't reassigned within someFunction()
because we again use 'var' which makes that myVar variable local to the function scope.

LS Solution:
JavaScript uses lexical scope. This means that it determines the scope of a variable by the structure of the program. This program declares a variable named myVar in two places. The first is outside of any function, giving the first myVar a global scope. The second place is inside of someFunction. Functions in JavaScript create a new scope â€” a scope that is "local" to the function. This local scope is also referred to as an "inner" scope in relation to the global "outer" scope.

On line 8, console.log(myVar) logs "This is global" because the two myVar variables, on lines 1 and 4, belong to different scopes. someFunction has its own local "inner" scope, so the myVar declaration within the function has no effect on the global "outer" scope.
