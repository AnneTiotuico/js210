Concatenate two or more strings, one with your first name and one with your last
, to create a string with your full name as its value. For example, if your name 
is John Doe, think about how you can put 'John' and 'Doe' together to get 'John Doe'.

'Anne ' + 'Tiotuico'

Use the arithmetic operators to determine the individual digits of a 4-digit number like 4936:

thousands place is 4
hundreds place is 9
tens place is 3
ones place is 6


let currentNumber = 4936
let ones = currentNumber % 10
currentNumber = (currentNumber - ones) / 10

let tens = currentNumber % 10 
currentNumber = (currentNumber - tens) / 10

let hundreds = currentNumber % 10 

let thousands = currentNumber % 10 
currentNumber = (currentNumber - hundreds) / 10
